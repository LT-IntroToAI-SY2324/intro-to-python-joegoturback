# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I think Python is a much more simplified version of Java. I kind of wish i started with this instad of Java so that computer science would have been an easier start for me. Python has less coding jargon and everything feels more straightforward and more beginner-friendly. Pyton is definitely a great language to begin coding and develop a baseline, whereas Java is a bit more confusing. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Some similarities I found between Python and other programming languages like Java is that all of them are written into a compiler for them to be run. They also need to have zero errors otherwise the entire program wouldn't work. A
Differences between Python and other programming languages is of course, their syntax. Java uses System.out.println() to write something on the screen whereas Python merely uses print(), for example. 

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I learned how to make a popular game using Python and also the functions required to make it work. Other than that I had actually learned Python over the summer so thins like functions and randomizers were familiar to me.
